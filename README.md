This is a full-stack web application which allows two users to communicate with each other in real-time. Users will also see their previously sent and received messages upon login. 

The goal was to get an understanding of Vue.js on the front-end, MongoDB on the backend, and how to connect the two together. Vue.js components allowed me to organize my code and provide a seamless user experience. I was also able to use vue-router which took care of the routing on the front-end of the application. Using Mongoose, I was able to set up models which specified schemas of how the data should be inserted into the MongoDB database.
